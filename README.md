# Mini-COS — GitHub-ready project

A production-oriented, **GitHub-ready** monorepo scaffold tailored to Cozey's Senior Software Engineer role.
Contains a simple TypeScript backend (Express + Lambda-ready handlers), a frontend React (Vite + TS) stub,
a serverless.yml sample, basic tests, and CI workflow example.

## Quick start (local)
Prereqs: Node 18+, npm, (optional) Serverless Framework for deploys.

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd mini-cos
npm install
# Run backend in dev
cd backend && npm run dev
# Run frontend in dev
cd ../frontend && npm run dev
```
